The goal of Maptime is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies. Maptime is open to everyone, from lifelong professional cartographers to ordinary folks who just like to look at, use, or make maps.

For the *inaugural meeting* of Maptime Upper Valley, we'll talk about the organization of the group, recruit co-organizers, and hold a map show-and-tell: bring any kind of map—it could be paper or digital, one you made or one you found—and tell the group something cool about it.

The event will be in the *Community Room of the Kilton Public Library* in West Lebanon, NH.

RSVPs are not required, but there will be *free pizza*, so registering will help us plan how much food to have available.
